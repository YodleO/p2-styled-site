                    <h2>Section 1: About Me</h2>
                    <h3>(Pulled from Introduction assignment)</h3>
                    I am a (super) senior (5th year) working on my BSs in Data Science: Business and Data Science: Computer Science. 
                    I am also the current vice president of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity. I have had an internship at Mylo, 
                    an insurance broker that is a child company of Lockton, and an internship that I just finished this summer at Sprint 
                    helping the IT Integration Management Office (IMO) team work on the Sprint - T-Mobile merger. I am from Dearborn, Missouri 
                    which is a small town of about 500-600 people. I came into Northwest as a math education major and decided I wanted to 
                    explore possibilities more than just going to high school, going to college to go back to high school, and go back to high school. 
                    In my spare time I play video games (Xbox and Switch mostly) and if I am playing chances are that it is Rocket League. 
                    After college I am looking to find a job in Kansas City in a field that is something similar to data science, if not an actual 
                    data scientist position. Similar areas I think I would be interested in would be business intelligence, database management, 
                    data visualizer (or whatever the official position name would be), or some business bridge between the business side of a company 
                    and wherever the data comes from to properly communicate what exactly the data means. Something interesting about me? 
                    I can snap off of anything. That isn't really a big thing, but it is kinda cool I think. Here is my 
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaleb-odle-4a803514b">LinkedIn</a> if you want to shoot me a connection with a message saying you're from this class!

                    <p>This video is actually kinda special to me. I'm not great at doing work. I get distracted super easily. Once I get going though, man 
                        do I get going. This video is the first video that introduced me to lofi, chillhop, and now what I listen to a majority of the time 
                        when I want to get stuff done, chillstep. I highly encourage anyone reading this to play this video and check it out. It, or the things 
                        I listed, may help your productivity too.

                    <h2>Section 3: Citations</h2>
                    <p>Guess what! I am not a huge, great guy that can get everything myself! I need to rely on others to get stuff made so I can rely on it! 
                        Economies of scale, right? Therefore, there were a couple of things that I grabbed from the internet. Here is what they were:
                    </p>
                    
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Unoriginal Work</th>
                            <th>Link to Actual Work</th>
                        </tr>
